# The Odin Project - Calculator

![Image](./img/screenshot.png)

This is a calculator webpage created as part of The Odin Project. The calculator allows you to string operations together to get the right answer, and the calculator can only evaluate a single pair of numbers at a given time.

### Outcomes
- Gained a better understanding of JavaScript functions and structure
- Aimed to improve code readability
- Applied what I learned through the curriculum about mathematical functions in JavaScript
- Learned more about applying JavaScript to mathematical operations
- Used logical thinking to ensure that the calculator functions as expected and to improve user experience (e.g., ensure '=' cannot be pressed too early with JavaScript)
- Improved on structuring and formatting HTML and CSS elements
- Used Git and GitHub for overall project management
